The individual is expressing a desire to harm themselves (\"I wanna myself kill\") following the death of their baby, which suggests suicidal ideation. This is a significant red flag, indicating a high risk of self-harm or suicidal behavior. The language used is simple and direct, conveying a sense of desperation and hopelessness.\\n\\nThe threat level is assessed as 8/10 due to the explicit expression of suicidal thoughts.
